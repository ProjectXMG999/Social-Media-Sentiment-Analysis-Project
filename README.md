4. Influencer identification: The tool would identify social media users who have a large following and who are influential in shaping the sentiment of others.
5. Customization: The tool would be customizable, allowing companies and organizations to define their own sentiment categories and keywords to monitor.
6. Visualization: The tool would provide visualizations of sentiment trends and other insights to make it easy to understand and act upon the data.

### Example Use Case: 
A company that manufactures a popular brand of athletic shoes wants to monitor how the brand is being perceived on social media. The company would use the sentiment analysis tool to monitor social media feeds for posts related to their brand. The tool would analyze the sentiment of each post and track sentiment trends over time. The company would be able to identify influencers who are shaping sentiment and respond quickly to negative sentiment to protect their brand reputation.

### Overall:
